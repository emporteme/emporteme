### Hi there 👋

👋 Hi, I'm [YourName]!

- 🔭 I’m currently working on a client-side application that interacts with blockchain technology, using Next.js (React.js with SSR) 💻
- 🌱 I’m currently learning Nest.js (Express) to be able to create REST APIs 🚀
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate on full-stack projects, user interactions, and email integrations 🌐
- 🤔 I’m looking for help with Nest.js, as I'm a beginner. However, I have experience with Django REST API 🐍
- 💬 Ask me about Frontend, MVP projects, and anything related to blockchain ⛓️
- 📫 How to reach me: [Telegram](https://t.me/emporteme) 📩
- 😄 Pronouns: he/him (I'm not gay) 🧑
- ⚡ Fun fact: I don't really love IT, but for me, it's the easiest way to make more money in a short period and achieve my goals 💰

Feel free to connect with me on GitHub and let's collaborate on some awesome projects! 🤝
